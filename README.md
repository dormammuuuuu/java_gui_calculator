# java_gui_calculator
This is a simple JAVA CALCULATOR with GUI. It can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program takes the value of the numbers (entered by the user) and then performs the selected operation.

Note : this program might not run in an online compiler. I highly recommend that you use NetBeans 12 IDE.

How to use:
1. Create a new project
    - Java with Ant > Java Application
2. Delete the main file.
3. Create a new JFrame Form. (Class name= MainUI)
4. Replace the files in the project folder then compile and run.
